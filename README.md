## 🚀 Ways to Contribute

You don’t always need to write code to contribute! Here are different ways:

* **Code Contributions**: Fix bugs, add new features, optimize performance.
* **Documentation**: Improve README, write tutorials, fix typos.
* **Design**: UI/UX improvements, logos, or visuals.
* **Community Support**: Answer questions, review issues, help newcomers.
* **Testing & QA**: Report bugs, suggest improvements.
